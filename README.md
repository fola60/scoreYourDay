# About the Project

This project is a tool for students, or anyone to keep track of, not only their tasks but the progress they have made in each of their tasks.
It provides users with a simple and friendly UI and easy to use components.
You can also dynamically make tasks for each day of the week, month or year. As well as providing analytics on what days, weeks and months the user performs well on and doesnt perform well. 
The implementation of a test score rating motivates users to maintain a high score each day by completing each of their tasks with a 100% score.


### Key Features:
- **Add tasks dynamically**: Users can add the same task to each day of the week, month or year.
- **Test Score View**: Users can view their current score in their desired test score format in the landing page.
- **Analytics**: Users can see how well they do on each day of the week or month of the year, and also see how close they are to their target score.
